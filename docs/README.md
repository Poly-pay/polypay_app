# Introduction

### What is PolyPay?

PolyPay is a privacy-preserving payroll platform built on Horizen. It enables organizations, DAOs, and global teams to run payroll privately while staying on their preferred blockchain.

### The Problem

Current on-chain payment solutions expose sensitive information publicly:

* Employee salaries are visible to everyone
* Payment recipients can be tracked
* Multisig approvers are publicly identified

This lack of privacy prevents businesses from adopting crypto payroll.

### Our Solution

PolyPay combines **Horizen's privacy layer** with **cross-chain settlement** to provide:

* **Private Payments**: Salary amounts and recipients stay confidential
* **Private Multisig**: Team approvals without exposing signer identities
* **Flexible Payment Logic**: Escrow, milestone-based, and recurring transfers

### Who Is It For?

* Crypto-native startups and SMBs
* DAOs managing contributor payments
* Traditional businesses entering crypto
* Teams using Safe or Squads who want privacy upgrades
